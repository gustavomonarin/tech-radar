Azure SQL Database,Hold,Tools,FALSE,Azure SQL Database is an adaptation of Microsoft SQL server to the cloud infrastructure. ,Database Architect,Kelvin Schmalle,
Event Storming,Trial,Agile & Team Practices,FALSE,,PDLG,Andrew K,"Remove this, maybe, very few items in Agile & Team Practices"
Single-instance message processors,Hold,Patterns & Techniques,FALSE,"Limiting message processing to a single thread can be alluring when the goal is to eliminate duplicate and out-of-order messages. In practice, it reduces their frequency but does not eliminate them, and limits scalability and resiliency. Message processors should strive to be idempotent and tolerant of out-of-order messages.",Architecture,,Archive
Graphite,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,https://github.com/iQmetrix/product-excellence/blob/master/monitoring-and-alerting/graphite.md,SRE Observability,,Jeff Eggen to find chamption. Docs need updating
In order message processing,Hold,Patterns & Techniques,FALSE,Forcing messages to be processed in the exact order they were published causes many problems for systems processing messages. Message processors should be flexible enough to accept messages out of order to ensure high availability and throughput.,Architecture,,Maybe merge with next one and single instance above
Exactly once message delivery,Hold,Patterns & Techniques,FALSE,"Most messaging systems that provide guaranteed delivery, including Azure Service Bus, will deliver messages multiple times in certain circumstances. Instead of attempting to force messages to be processed exactly once, message processors should be designed to be idempotent.",Architecture,,Maybe merge with prev one and single instance above
Aha,Adopt,Agile & Team Practices,FALSE,,PMLG,Lauren Wilmsen,"Find champion, add docs"

Foundation Messaging,Hold,Tools,FALSE,"Foundation Messaging is an internally-developed library for interacting with Azure Service Bus. It encourages recommended patterns for writing messaging-oriented applications, and is designed to discourage the use of dangerous anti-patterns.

Azure Blob Storage,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,,PDLG,,Review description and owner
Event Sourcing,Assess,Patterns & Techniques,FALSE,"Event sourcing is a data modeling pattern where all events that led to the current state of a domain aggregate are stored instead of just storing the current state. The events are stored in an immutable and append only data store. Some techniques that this enables are: replaying all previous events when debugging problems, temporal querying where you can see the state of an aggregate at any point in time, replaying all events in order to build a new query projection. Challenges include: the loss of adhoc queryability of data, event versioning issues, problems reloading aggregates with large numbers of events.",PDLG,Andrew K,Update docs around what we are assessing?

RQ Sproc Bridge Service,Assess,Tools,FALSE,"The RQ Sproc Bridge Service allows code from outside RQ to call sprocs within the RQ Database. The sprocs should be created outside the dbo namespace, and are written, owned, and maintained by the team that calls them. Data that is accessed from a service via Sproc Bridge should be data that the service intends to own one day. These sprocs should be viewed as a temporary measure; calls to the Sproc Bridge Service should eventually be replaced by the service owning the data itself.",PDLG,Andrew K,Link to policy

CQS,Adopt,Patterns & Techniques,FALSE,"The <a href=""https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html"">Command Query Separation</a> pattern is fundamentally about keeping queries side-effect free, ie: asking a question shouldn't change the answer. This principle aims to keep interfaces simple and the consequences of calling a method obvious.",PDLG,Andrew K,
IQ.Vanilla CQS AOP,Hold,"Languages, Frameworks & Platforms",FALSE,"Libraries such as <a href=""https://github.com/iQmetrix/IQ.Vanilla.CQS.AOP"">IQ.Vanilla.CQS.AOP</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/RyanMarcotte/Functional.CQS"">Functional.CQS</a> have been found to provide limited benefit and increased complexity.
