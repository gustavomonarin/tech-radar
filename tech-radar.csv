Event Storming,Adopt,Agile & Team Practices,TRUE,,Andrew K,
Single-instance message processors,Hold,Patterns & Techniques,FALSE,"Limiting message processing to a single thread can be alluring when the goal is to eliminate duplicate and out-of-order messages. In practice, it reduces their frequency but does not eliminate them, and limits scalability and resiliency. Message processors should strive to be idempotent and tolerant of out-of-order messages.",,Need details explaining the streaming (kafka) approach vs the ASB/IQ.M approach

Event Sourcing,Assess,Patterns & Techniques,FALSE,"Event sourcing is a data modeling pattern where all events that led to the current state of a domain aggregate are stored instead of just storing the current state. The events are stored in an immutable and append only data store. Some techniques that this enables are: replaying all previous events when debugging problems, temporal querying where you can see the state of an aggregate at any point in time, replaying all events in order to build a new query projection. Challenges include: the loss of adhoc queryability of data, event versioning issues, problems reloading aggregates with large numbers of events.",Andrew K,Update docs around what we are assessing?

RQ Sproc Bridge Service,Assess,Tools,FALSE,"The RQ Sproc Bridge Service allows code from outside RQ to call sprocs within the RQ Database. The sprocs should be created outside the dbo namespace, and are written, owned, and maintained by the team that calls them. Data that is accessed from a service via Sproc Bridge should be data that the service intends to own one day.
